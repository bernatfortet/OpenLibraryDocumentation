# OpenLibraryDocumentation

This repository includes the draft for the documentation of OpenLibrary as AsciiDoc, mostly for preview and testing.

The documentation is written in AsciiDoc using [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/). AsciiDoc allows conversion in multiple formats easily while also being somewhat easy to write and otherwise handle manually.
